# 3D Graphics Renderer

This repo houses a 3D graphics renderer I've built, inspired by Masters-level graphics programming. It's not for an actual degree - just me geeking out on my own time.

Key features:
- Custom model loading (MD2 format)
- Full 3D transformation pipeline
- Back-face culling
- Painter's algorithm for depth sorting
- Lighting models: ambient, directional, and point lights
- Flat shading implementation
